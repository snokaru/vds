# vds
A library of data structures that I implement for practice whenever I have the time.
The library tries its best to implement an interface that is similar to the STL equivalents.

## Current Data Structures
- Linked List Based
  - Singly Linked List (SLList)
  - Doubly Linked List (DLList)
  - Circular Linked List (CLList)
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Deque
- Priority Queue
- Maps
  - Ordered
    - Array Map
    - Skip List Map
  - Unordered Hash Map
## Todo
Currently, the provided iterators are lacking and could be improved, as there is no support for const_iterator, and some of the data structures return non-const iterators through const functions.
